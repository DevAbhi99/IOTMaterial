//Arduino Inbuilt functions


//void setup() :- Code gets executed only once

//void loop() :- Code gets executed in a loop


//digitalRead(pin) :- Reads digital data from the pin

//digitalWrite(pin, mode) :- Provides Digital output in two modes (HIGH,LOW)

//pinMode(pin, mode) :- sets up the pin usually written within the void setup loop. mode are INPUT/OUTPUT

//analogRead(pin) :- reads analog data

//analogWrite(pin, value):- It is ued to controll analog signals as the value specified. Used for pulse width modulation

//Serial.begin(9600) :- 9600 is baud unit or data rate in bits per second(when communication happens serially between computer and arduino). This command starts the serial communication

//Serial.available() :- After serial communication is initialized. how many times the serial communication is established

//Serial.read() :- takes user input. usually takes char value but can be converted to int using number-'0'

//Serial.println():- It is used to print values in serial monitor


//remaining all the code syntaxes are same as java
